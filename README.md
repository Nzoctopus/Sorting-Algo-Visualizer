 ## About The Project

![Project](https://socialify.git.ci/Nzoctopus/Sorting-Algo-Visualizer/image?font=Raleway&language=1&name=1&owner=1&pattern=Charlie%20Brown&theme=Dark)

A visual tool that demonstrates various sorting algorithms using C++ and the SFML Graphics Library. It provides a simple way to visualize how different sorting algorithms work, using colors and animation to enhance understanding. The program counts the number of operations executed by each algorithm, including comparisons and swaps.
 ### Built With

Here's the tools I use to create this project.

- [C++](https://cplusplus.com/reference/)
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.1/)
 ## Getting Started

How to run the program:
 ### Prerequisites

You must have the SFML library installed.
- On fedora:
  ```sh
  sudo dnf update
  sudo dnf install SFML SFML-devel
  ```
- On Ubuntu / Debian:
```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```
- On Arch Linux:
```sh
  sudo pacman -S sfml
```
 ## Usage

```sh
make
./visualizer
```
